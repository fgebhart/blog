This is particularly helpful for a topological map model like this as the first few layers do not need high precision at all. In most cases these are of rectangular shape with very little details. The only details in the first few layers are the text and the magnet slots, but their shape is constant along the z-axis, thus their outcome is independent of the configured layer height.</p> <ol> <li>Open up PrusaSlicer and simply drag and drop your customized STL file into it.      </li> <li>First, I recommend to initially slice your model with the default settings (i.e. 0.2mm layer height) in order to get an impression of how long such a print will take. Slicing my model with a 0.2mm layer height and 10% infill would take roughly 11.5h.</li> <li>After the slicing computation has finished, we should scroll through all layers, to quickly inspect whether everything looks as expected. Have a closer look at the outcome of the text and the magnet slots! Consider the following items for verification:<ul> <li>Check that the magnet slots do not overlap with the text or that there is enough space between.</li> <li>Check that there are sufficient layers above the magnet slots, such that the magnets do not shine though.</li> <li>Check that the orientation of the text is as expected.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>If everything looks good, go back to the \"3D editor view\" of the plater and click on the variable layer height feature in the top bar.      </li> <li>Drag the slider in of the \"Quality / Speed\" option to the left most position and hit the Adaptive button next to it. The result should look similar to the following image. The algorithm will automatically detect the level of detail from one layer to the next one and set the layer height accordingly.       If you hover over the individual layers in the layer stack column, you'll see that the first few layers will get a much coarser layer height (in my case ~0.25mm) compared to the remaining upper layer heights (~0.07mm). This particular use cases really leverages the potential of the variable layer height feature if you want to find the sweet spot between quality and speed. Note though, using variable layer height increases the print time to ~21h in my example.</li> </ol> <p>Tip</p> <p>Topological maps with coarse layer heights also look super interesting.

Usually, configuring the custom domain on the GitHub Pages settings tab will add a CNAME file to the branch from which your static page will be deployed. However, a GitHub Action could be implemented in such a way, that it would overwrite the CNAME file with every commit. If this is the case, you would need to add the file manually to your repo. To do so, have a look at the deploy branch of your repo (usually <code>gh-pages</code>) to conclude which folder of your source code branch will be deployed from the deploy branch. In the root of this folder, you have to add a file called <code>CNAME</code> (all uppercase). The content of the file must contain a single line only, which is the custom URL to point to your GitHub Page. In the case of this blog, here is the CNAME file which contains <code>blog.fgebhart.dev</code>.
