# Welcome

Hi :wave: my name is [Fabian Gebhart](https://fgebhart.dev) and this is my blog.

I blog about tech, Python, the PyData stack, 3d-Printing and more. A large fraction of my posts are how-to guides, which hopefully help you solve a particular problem. Head over to the [tags section](tags.md) to see all currently existing topics.

## My Blogging Philosophy
1. **Community Engagement**: Finding people with similar interests online is easy nowadays. While community engagement can be challenging, it can also be enriching to share projects, ideas and thoughts.
2. **Learning**: Learning is bilateral. Not only the reader will learn something from the blog post, also the author has to achieve profound knowledge of the written material.
3. **Sharing is Caring**: So many great articles, blogs, docs and books out there that I read and absorbed. Thanks to everyone who is sharing their knowledge. This blog is about giving back my learnings.
4. **Efficiency**: Keep everything compact and concise :rocket:
